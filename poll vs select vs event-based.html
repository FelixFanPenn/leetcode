<p> I failed to find a thorough comparison page on <a href="http://opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908799/xsh/poll.html">poll()</a> vs

 <a href="http://opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908799/xsh/select.html">select()</a>

 so I wrote my own. If you find flaws or have additions, please let me know!
 My <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2010/07/17/poll-vs-select/">blog

 post</a> also provides some background.
</p><p> Differences between <b>poll()</b> and <b>select()</b> and to the end some
 mentions about the more modern event-driven alternatives such as epoll(),
 kqueue and more. I recommend a library such as <a href="http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/libev.html">libev</a> or <a href="http://www.monkey.org/~provos/libevent/">libevent</a>.

</p><p> Those libs make it possible to write event-based programs in a portable
manner, as the underlying technologies like <a href="http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man4/epoll.4.html">epoll</a>

(Linux), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kqueue">kqueue</a> (FreeBSD,

</p><div class="subtitle" align="left"> History </div>
<p>
 select() was introduced in 4.2BSD Unix, released in August 1983.
</p><p>
 poll() was introduced in SVR3 Unix, released 1986. In Linux, the poll()
 system call was introduced in 2.1.23 (January 1997) while the poll() library
 call was introduced in libc 5.4.28 (May 1997)
</p><div class="subtitle" align="left"> Functionality </div>
<p>
 select() and poll() provide basically the same functionality. They only
 differ in the details:
</p><ul>
<li> select() overwrites the fd_set variables whose pointers are passed in as
 arguments 2-4, telling it what to wait for. This makes a typical loop having
 to either have a backup copy of the variables, or even worse, do the loop to
 populate the bitmasks every time select() is to be called. poll() doesn't
 destroy the input data, so the same input array can be used over and over.
</li><li> poll() handles many file handles, like more than 1024 by default and
 without any particular work-arounds. Since select() uses bitmasks for file
 descriptor info with fixed size bitmasks it is much less convenient. On some
 operating systems like Solaris, you can compile for support with &gt; 1024 file
 descriptors by changing the FD_SETSIZE define.
</li><li> poll offers somewhat more flavours of events to wait for, and to receive,
 although for most common networked cases they don't add a lot of value
</li><li> Different timeout values. poll takes milliseonds, select takes a struct
 timeval pointer that offers microsecond resolution. In practise however,
 there probably isn't any difference that will matter.
</li></ul>
<p> Going with an event-based function instead should provide the same
 functionality as well. They do however often force you to use a different
  approach since they're often callback-based that get triggered by events,
  instead of the loop style approach select and poll encourage.
</p><div class="subtitle" align="left"> Speed </div>
<p> poll and select are basically the same speed-wise: slow.
</p><ul>
<li> They both handle file descriptors in a linear way. The more descriptors
 you ask them to check, the slower they get. As soon as you go beyond perhaps
 a hundred file descriptors or so - of course depending on your CPU and
 hardware - you will start noticing that the mere waiting for file descriptor
 activity and the following checking which file descriptor that it was, takes
 a significant time and becomes a bottle neck.
</li><li> The select() API with a "max fds" as first argument of course forces a
 scan over the bitmasks to find the exact file descriptors to check for, which
 the poll() API avoids. A small win for poll().
</li><li> select() only uses (at maximum) three bits of data per file descriptor,
while poll() typically uses 64 bits per file descriptor. In each syscall
invoke poll() thus needs to copy a lot more over to kernel space. A small win
for select().
</li></ul>
<p> Going with an event-based function is the only sane option if you go
 beyond a small number of file descriptors. The libev guys did a <a href="http://libev.schmorp.de/bench.html">benchmarking of libevent against

 libev</a> and their results say clearly that libev is the faster one.
</p><p> Compared to poll and select, any event-based system will give a
performance boost already with a few hundred file descriptors and then the
benefit just grows the more connections you add.
</p><div class="subtitle" align="left"> Portability </div>
<p> <b>select</b> - has existed for a great while and exists almost
 everywhere. A problem with many file descriptors is that you cannot know if
 you will overflow the the bitmask as you can't check the file descriptor
 againt FD_SETSIZE in a portable manner.
</p><p> Many unix versions allow FD_SETSIZE to be re-defined at compile time, but
 Linux does not
</p><p> One quirk is that the include header required for the <i>fd_set</i> type
 varies between systems.
</p><p> Some - but not all - systems modify the timeout struct so that on return
from select, the program can know how long time actually passed. If you repeat
select() calls, you need to init the timeout struct each loop!
</p><p> <b>poll</b> - Not existing on older unixes nor in Windows before
 Vista. Broken implementation in Mac OS X at least up to 10.4 and earlier. Up
 to 10.3 you could check for a poll() that works with all arguments
 zeroed. The 10.4 bug is more obscure an I don't know of any way to detect it
 without checking for OS.
</p><p>
 Lots of early implementations did poll as a wrapper around select().
</p><p> poll's set of bits to return is fairly specific in the standards, but <a href="http://www.greenend.org.uk/rjk/2001/06/poll.html">vary a lot between

 implementations</a>
</p><div class="subtitle" align="left"> Complexity </div>
<p>
 All event-driven functions tend to make the code more complex, harder to
follow and require more code to be written to accomplish the same task as the
simple select and poll approaches do.

 For everyhing select/poll/event-based, there's the <a href="http://www.kegel.com/c10k.html">C10K problem page</a>, which is a true

 goldmine.
